Baskonia give away a victory in Israel
caja_laboral achieve a stunning @card@ victory on their visit to the Maccabee Electra court despite dusko_ivanovic 's team 's heavy loss , and after the great performance by Mizra Teltovic , who be the good on his team with eight three-pointer score ( @card@ point ) , they now at the top of their group .
the Vitorian team know to make up for the significant absence of Herrmann , Oleson , Huertas and Micov with a big dose of involvement and teamwork , even though it have to hold out until the end to take the victory .
additionally , their huge success from the sideline , with @card@ three_pointer score , have a lot to do with the final triumph .
the game start out in favor of the Azulgrana , who put themselves ahead on the scoreboard from the start .
as Vitora 's first four basket be from the perimeter , the speculation be already that they have jump into the Israeli net with hot wrist .
English and Teletovic be the main scorer of the @card@ at the end of the first_period .
the second quarter be more of the same , but the Alavan team opt for the inside game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu , who be greet with whistle and applause at his return home , to continue increase their lead by half-time ( @card@ ) .
Teletovic have already begin to stand out as the good on his team with @card@ point , even though Splitter 's `` six few '' point already signal that it be n't go to be the good night for the Brazilian .
but the game , despite be head for halftime , be not more decidedand the Maccabees try to remind the Vitorians that not just anybody win on their court , and with the ` hand of Elias ' put the pressure on , they manage to get involve in the game .
Eidson and Pnini play a decisive role in the `` yellow ' '' return to the light .
more disadvantage
Ivanovic 's player , injure but far from dead , need to run a couple of play correctly before they could breathe , and that be when the machine_gun Marza Teletovic arrive , with three almost consecutive three-pointer and the help of English and Ribas , he bring the scoreboard back to a reassuring lead ( @card@ ) , which the home team manage to narrow down at the end of the third quarter ( @card@ ) .
the Alavas work themselves to the bone in the last period , and English and san_emeterio ( @card@ ) have already make it clear that they be not go to let anyone take away what they have earn during the first thirty minute .
however , Pnini and Eidson , the good on their team , do not give up and try to keep their team alive from the three-point line ( @card@ ) .
in spite of this , and with Splitter foul out , Ivonic 's team do n't rush , defend well , and , even though the Israelis come close at the last_minute , the game was already win and victory escape tel_aviv for the first time in the season .
wall_street close without momentum , slow by a strengthening dollar
the new_york_stock_exchange close with no particular heading on Friday , in a market tear between good than expect indicator in the united_states and a strengthening dollar : the dow_jones gain @card@ % but the Nasdaq drop @card@ % .
accord to final closing figure , the dow_jones_industrial_average have rise by @card@ point to @card@ @card@ point , whereas the Nasdaq , with a technology predominance , fall by @card@ point to 2 @card@ point .
the wide standard_&_poor 's @card@ have itself advance by @card@ % ( @card@ point ) to 1 @card@ point .
frankly , the market be very calm , observe Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead asset_management .
it remain within a narrow_margin ; trading volume have become very weak , and I think that this will remain the case until the end of the year .
the trend be support by the publication of good than expect economic indicator , which `` have contribute to improve market opinion in relation to the robustness of the economic recovery '' , summarise charles_schwab 's analyst .

iraqi_oil_ministry reach deal with @card@ foreign oil_company
despite concern about violence and political instability , the Iraqi government manage to attract major oil_company to rebuild its ailing infrastructure during two auction that conclude Saturday .
the @card@ deal the iraqi_oil_ministry reach with foreign oil_company suggest that China , Russia and European oil firm be poise to play a major role in refurbish Iraq 's oil_industry , cripple by decade of war and sanction .

Two American company reach deal for field auction in June .
the meager representation of American oil giant in Iraq 's open oil_industry surprised analyst .
Iraq finally open its door after six year of war , and instead of U.S. company , you have Asians and Europeans lead the way , say Ruba Husari , the editor of iraq oil Forum , an online news outlet .
it will be a long_time before anything else will be on offer in Iraq .
concern over security , underscore by massive coordinate bombing Tuesday , and political instability as the U.S. military withdraw , likely keep American oil_company from venture more forcefully in Iraq , which have the world 's third-largest proven crude reserve , analyst say .
U.S. firm be in some case at a disadvantage because rival , particularly the Chinese and other government control energy firm , have markedly low labor_cost and be more prone to take risk because they do n't respond to shareholder .
Exxon-Mobil and occidental_petroleum Inc. be the only American company that reach deal with the ministry .
major U.S. firm such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips , which have cultivate close tie with the iraqi_oil_ministry and have provide technical advice in recent year , walk away empty-handed .
Russian company Lukoil and Gazprom be the top stakeholder in two of the contract award this weekend .
state-owned China_National_Petroleum_Corporation bid on more contract than any other company and walk away with large stake in contract for two major field .
we all know that China be on track to become a major economic as well as technological power , oil_ministry spokesman Assam Jihad say .
we feel confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitor and will deliver on its commitment towards Iraq .
company pre-selected to submit bid make offer that be then compare to the per barrel fee the ministry be willing to pay for boost output above current level at each field .
us bank repay state support
the crisis-hit US major bank be break free from their state shackle .
on Wednesday bank_of_america repay the support from the bank protection fund tarp in the amount USD @card@ billion ( nearly EUR @card@ billion ) in one go .
and , accord to report from US broadcaster CNBC , Citigroup be also plan to repay the state support .
the institution thereby want to wiggle themselves free from the restriction go hand-in-hand with the acceptance of the money , such as the limit on manager bonus and the pay of high charge .
bank_of_america have raise some USD @card@ billion from investor through convertible loan .
the rest of the amount be take from its own kitty , which be well fill through the sale of business unit .
Bank head ken_lewis extend his express thank to the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening : the cash injection help over a very difficult time .
the bank overstretched at the height of the financial crisis by take over the investment bank merrill_lynch .
Citigroup also plan to raise cash on the capital_market to free itself from its liability with the state .
already on Thursday , the US bank be able to announce a capital increase of some USD @card@ billion , report CNBC with reference to circle .
a Citigroup spokesman decline to comment .
goldman_sachs , jp_morgan_chase and morgan_stanley have already repay their support in June .
Cheshire appeal will point to Twitter
there be half_a_dozen of them type away in the courtroom row .
minute by minute , they send out report of gruesome testimony via Twitter .
in the end , the defense say , there be more than @card@ Twitter message about the trial that deal with rape and child tie to their bed in a house that be set ablaze .
on Thursday , the widely follow trial of steven_j._hayes , who be convict of kill three member of a Cheshire , Conn. , family , be set to come to an official end with the judge 's imposition of the death_sentence vote for by the jury .
but lawyer for Mr. Hayes have already make court filing that sketch out appeal argument that be likely to occupy the court for year .
One of the most provocative be that the intense reporting on the trial - include mainstream reporter ' extensive use of Twitter - create a `` circus atmosphere '' and such widespread , instant saturation with inflammatory detail that the jury be improperly sway by public passion .
the claim could force appeal judge to grapple with the question of whether new technology require new courtroom rule .
`` as I experience it during this trial , I think there be a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom be affect an individual 's fair-trial right , '' say thomas_j. Ullmann , Mr. Hayes 's chief defense_lawyer .
the trial_judge , Jon C. Blue of State superior_court , tersely reject the claim in a ruling last week , say that the news_media be `` carefully control '' and that there be no evidence the jury be drive by passion .
but that be not likely to be the last_word on the issue .
for decade , appeals_court have recognize that coverage of notorious case can raise question about a trial 's fairness .
in a landmark @card@ ruling , the united_states_supreme_court overturn the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath , Dr. sam_sheppard , for the murder of his wife , say in its decision , sheppard_v._maxwell , that there be a `` carnival atmosphere at trial '' because of the news_media .
the crime be believe by some to have be the inspiration for the television_show and the movie `` the_fugitive . ''
some lawyer say appeals_court review Mr. Hayes 's conviction half a century later might be intrigue by the argument that new rule could be necessary to govern way of communicate from courtroom unimagin at the time of Dr. Sheppard 's case .
`` there be a general reason for concern about the impact of the new_media '' in high-profile trial , say john_j._donohue_iii , a stanford_law_school professor who study the Connecticut death_penalty and write a report that say it be arbitrarily enforce .
Professor Donohue say some appeal judge might be intrigue by the idea that limit instant communication from courtroom might make trial fair .
the Twitter issue be just one of many outline by Mr. Hayes 's lawyer that be likely to be argue for year , delay an execution .
the defense_lawyer also claim , for example , that Mr. Hayes may have be prejudice when Judge Blue decline to allow them to test potential juror ' reaction by show them grisly crime-scene photograph during jury_selection .
some of the juror have say they be horrify by the photograph of the victim , jennifer_hawke-petit , @card@ , and her daughter , Hayley , @card@ , and Michaela , @card@ .
the defense_lawyer say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death_penalty and argue that the judge wrongly remove a juror who have be critical of prosecutor and that he improperly add pressure for a verdict by his unusual decision to direct the jury to deliberate over a weekend .
the juror be not sequester .
but their argument about the effect of the intense coverage of the trial may draw the most interest .
they note in a challenge to the verdict file last month that the case dominate the news in Connecticut and be discuss during the election campaign by candidate for governor and the united_states_senate .
they argue that the news_media continually fan the flame of emotion about the case .
`` the daily crush of media tweet , camera and reporter outside the courthouse , '' the lawyer write , `` be unlike anything ever see here in new_haven and maybe statewide . ''
their focus on the Twitter coverage be controversial .
in interview , some journalist say the claim that instant news be more incendiary than report deliver more slowly be a Luddite view that would make poor court policy govern coverage of future trial .
but some lawyer say appeals_court be often attract to argument that social and technological change require adaptation by the court .
Mr. Hayes 's lawyer be press that claim .
in their filing , they refer to the supreme_court 's @card@ decision overturn Dr. Sheppard 's conviction because of the trial coverage and make it clear they would claim that the new_media require new rule .
`` this case , '' they write , `` represent the sheppard_v._maxwell of the 21st century . ''
sport and fraud law
trick such as those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate wittiness but not the will to get remove of a sanction .
the expulsion presumably forge by two player of real_madrid ( xabi_alonso and sergio_ramos ) in the game play on the 23rd_of_november against Ajax in european_champions_league have cause river of ink to be write about if such behavior be or be not unsportsmanlike and if , both player should be sanction by UEFA .
as we all know , a few minute before the end of the game ( that their team have already win ) , both player deliberately waste time which make the referee show the second yellow card to both of them .
this way , and since real_madrid will finish as leader of its group , both player will fulfil the prescribed sanction during the next game of league , against Auxerre , and will be able to get rid of the card the follow phase .
finally , the committee of discipline of the UEFA have sanction with two game the trainer of the team , jose_mourinho , and with different economic amount the implied player .
the provocation of a yellow card in similar circumstance as this one be not a new practice , but rather frequent in the world of football .
it be so extend that it part of the ethos , of the unwritten rule , but follow nonetheless by this sport .
part of the debate arise in the related case be cause by the fact that have be carry out by team of the real_madrid organization ( that in its hymn presume of nobility and honor , and that have fine its player for analogous act ) and by the dramatization orchestrate , apparently , by Mourinho , who add one more to his expanded history of histrionic and provoking technician .
anyway , the debate deal with if that type of behavior not prohibit specifically by the regulation contradict the principle of the sport , that be to say , if with these action fraud be commit ; then , indeed , they be respectful action with the sport regulation , but they seem to elude its sense .
the matter examine the type of damage that be bring to the sporting spirit .
One of the advantage that include the sport spirit be the physical integrity of the opposite player , aspect that with these action be n't put into danger , that be to say , there be no violent game .
another of these advantage to which it be allude to with the fare-play be to avoid that the team of the lawbreaker player take advantage unjustly of the opposite team , which do not happen either .
however , the paradoxical thing about the action of the player of real_madrid be that it do not comply to what we normally characterize as legal_fraud , because the violation of the rule be not make secretly as to try to avoid the sanction , but their action be most evident and thus they receive punishment from the referee .
they wait for and accept the sanction with no complaint .
another question be what type of advantage the violator obtain in the action deliberately carry out .
here it seem necessary to state that it be n't a disadvantageous situation for rival nor be an obtain benefit in the same game , because evidently the result of the action suppose leave their own team with less player .
and neither be it a useful strategy for the next game , because the club will not be able to count on those player .
the advantage , obviously , consist in the fact that the player will begin the follow phase of the championship without card that could threaten their participation in a future game .
but it be about a long term advantage , with a certain degree of indetermination , because the team can be eliminate first of change , and in addition with this action the player fulfil a sanction game and go to the second cycle of card , in which the suspension by card accumulation take place with one less than in the first cycle .
so that , by pass round , it be not so clear that it be an advantage .
those action be really against the sporting spirit , which be part of the strategic decision that favor take advantage allow by the rule .
regard this assumption , the player do not act in order to avoid the application of the sanction ( this would have be a clear case of legal_fraud ) , but rather choose when to obey it .
they make a strategic decision without avoid the punishment .
although the border between the wittiness and the law fraud be diffuse , in this occasion I believe it be a clear case of wittiness .
the controversy seem to arise from two factor : because it be about two auto expulsion and the way the transmission of the directive be carry out to cause them .
the damage bring about to the principle of the sport by these action be not as much ethical as aesthetic .
Arsenic-tolerant microbe raise possibility of new type of life_on_earth , or elsewhere
the discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrient widen the scope for find new form of life_on_earth and possibly beyond .
while researcher discover the unusual bacterium here on Earth , they say it show that life have possibility beyond the major element that have be consider essential .
`` this organism have dual capability . ''
`` it can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic . ''
`` that make it very peculiar , though it fall short of be some form of truly ` alien ' life , '' comment paul_c._w._davies of arizona_state_university , a co-author of the report appear in Thursday 's online edition of the journal science .
Six major element have long be consider essential for life - carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and sulfur .
but the researcher find that the bacterium , discover in mono_lake , Calif. , be able to continue to grow after substitute arsenic for phosphorus .
`` it make you wonder what else be possible , '' say Ariel D. Anbar of arizona_state_university , a co-author of the report .
the find be important in the search for life beyond earth because researcher need to be able to recognize life , to know what life look like , Anbar say .
the study focus on a microbe find on Earth .
however , the announcement of a news_conference to discuss it , which do not disclose detail of the find , generate widespread speculation on the Internet that the report would disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial_life .
the discovery `` do show that in other planetary environment organism might be able to use other element to drive biochemistry and that the ` standard ' set of element we think be absolutely necessary for life might not be so fix , '' comment charles_cockell , professor at planetary and space science research_institute , open_university , in milton_keynes , united_kingdom .
Cockell be not part of the research team .
`` this work be novel because it show the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure , '' add Cockell .
it be n't a chance discovery .
felisa_wolfe-simon of NASA 's Astrobiology Institute , who lead the study , target mono_lake because it have high arsenic level .
arsenic and phosphorus be chemically similar , so she speculate that a microbe expose to both might be able to substitute one for the other .
`` arsenic be toxic mainly because its chemical behavior be so similar to that of phosphorus . ''
`` as a result , organism have a hard_time tell these element apart . ''
`` but arsenic be different enough that it do n't work as well as phosphorus , so it get in there and sort of gum up the works of our biochemical machinery , '' explain Anbar .
the researcher collect the bacterium know as GFAJ-1 and expose it to increase concentration of arsenic , which it be able to adapt to and grow .
the microbe do grow well on phosphorus , but show that it can live with arsenic instead raise the possibility that a life_form use arsenic could occur naturally , either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic be more common .
Jamie S. Foster , an assistant_professor of microbiology at the university_of_florida , say the idea that arsenic could be substitute for phosphorus be n't new , but there have never be example where it be show to work .
arsenic be more common in the early time on Earth , she say , so researcher have speculate that early life_form might have use it .
`` it do suggest that that there could be other way to form life , not just how life form on early earth , '' say Foster , who be not part of Wolfe-Simon 's research team .
the research be support by NASA , the department_of_energy and the national_institutes_of_health .
the democratic routine
support for democracy in latin_america continue to edge up , as do backing for private_enterprise .
crime have become a big worry than unemployment .
and Brazil be see as more influential than the united_states across much of the region .
those be some of the finding of the late Latinobarmetro poll take in @card@ country and publish exclusively by the economist .
because the poll have be take regularly since @card@ , it track change in attitude across the region .
Two related thing stand out in the result of this year 's poll , take in September and early October .
the first be latin_america 's fairly sunny mood .
the second be the increase stability of attitude towards democracy and its core institution .
support for democracy have rise noticeably in several country on the Pacific_rim of south_america ( see table 1 ) .
for example in Peru , where economic_growth have average 6 % a year since @card@ , support for democracy have rise from a low of @card@ % in @card@ to @card@ % this year .
it also rise in Mexico , where the economy have recover after suffer a big drop in output last year .
but only around half of respondent in Mexico and Brazil , the region 's two most populous country , be convinced democrat , which drag down the regional average ( see chart 2 ) .
some @card@ % of respondent across the region pronounce themselves satisfy with how their country 's democracy work in practice , the same figure as last year but a big increase on the @card@ % in @card@ ( chart 3 ) .
some @card@ % say they have confidence in their country 's Congress and @card@ % in their government , the same as last year in both case but up sharply from @card@ ( @card@ % and @card@ % respectively ) .
a decade ago economic woe in latin_america undermine support for democracy .
that it have hold up during the world financial_crisis be probably because many Latin American country suffer only a brief recession and have enjoy a strong recovery .
in addition , a strong social safety_net have help to shield the poor .
( the united_nations ' economic_commission_for_latin_america report this week that the proportion of latin_americans living in poverty rise only marginally in @card@ and have fall again this year , to @card@ % . -RRB-
but the mood vary widely from country to country ( see chart 4 ) .
Brazil 's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president , luiz_incio_lula_da_silva , be reflect in a widely share sense of progress .
that be scarce in Mexico and central_america , where the recession be more severe and violent crime have worsen .
for only the second time since the poll begin , more respondent across latin_america as a whole cite crime , rather than unemployment , as the most important problem face their country ( see chart 5 ) .
some @card@ % say that either they or a close relative have be victim of crime over the past year , but that be down from @card@ % last year and be the low figure since @card@ .
a more robust economic performance be reflect in rise support for private_enterprise and the market_economy : some @card@ % of respondent across the region say that private_enterprise be indispensable for development , up from @card@ % in @card@ ( see chart 6 ) .
some @card@ % agree that the market_economy be the only system that will make their country develop , up from @card@ % last year .
interestingly , @card@ % of respondent in Venezuela hold that view ( and @card@ % there back private_enterprise ) even though their left-wing president , hugo_chvez , be expropriate many private company .
Brazil be the country which exercise most leadership in the region , mention by @card@ % of respondent ( up from @card@ % last year ) , follow by the united_states ( 9 % , unchanged from last year ) and Venezuela ( 9 % , down from @card@ % last year ) .
but the united_states be see as the most influential country by respondent in mexico and much of central_america , whereas Venezuela enjoy that distinction in Ecuador , the dominican_republic and Nicaragua .
Scalia and Thomas dine with healthcare law challenger as court take case
the day the supreme_court gather behind closed door to consider the politically divisive question of whether it would hear a challenge to president_obama 's healthcare law , two of its justice , antonin_scalia and clarence_thomas , be fete at a dinner sponsor by the law_firm that will argue the case before the high_court .
the occasion be last thursday , when all nine justice meet for a conference to pour over the petition for review .
One of the case at issue be a suit bring by @card@ state challenge the sweeping healthcare overhaul pass by Congress last year , a law that have be a rallying_cry for conservative activist nationwide .
the justice agree to hear the suit ; indeed , a landmark 5 - hour argument be expect in March , and the outcome be likely to further roil the @card@ presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time the court 's decision be release .
the lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the law should be throw out be likely to be paul_clement , who serve as U.S._solicitor_general during the George_W._Bush_administration .
Clement 's law_firm , bancroft_pllc , be one of almost two_dozen firm that help sponsor the annual dinner of the federalist_society , a longstanding group dedicate to advocate conservative legal_principle .
another firm that sponsor the dinner , jones_day , represent one of the trade_association that challenge the law , the national_federation_of_independent_business .
another sponsor be pharmaceutical giant pfizer_inc , which have an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the litigation .
the dinner be hold at a Washington hotel hour after the court 's conference over the case .
in attendance be , among other , mitch_mcconnell , the Senate 's top Republican and an avowed opponent of the healthcare_law .
the feature guest at the dinner ? Scalia and Thomas .
it be nothing new : the two justice have be attend federalist_society event for year .
and it be nothing that run afoul of ethic rule .
in fact , justice be exempt from the code_of_conduct that govern the action of low federal justice .
if they be , they arguably fall under code 's Canon 4C , which state , `` a judge may attend fund-raising event of law-related and other organization although the judge may not be a speaker , a guest_of_honor , or feature on the program of such an event . ''
nevertheless , the sheer proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law_firm in the case , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest , be enough to alarm ethics-in-government activist .
`` this stunning breach of ethic and indifference to the code belie claim by several justice that the court abide by the same rule that apply to all other federal_judge , '' say bob_edgar , the president of common_cause .
`` the justice be wine and dine at a black-tie fundraiser with attorney who have pend case before the court . ''
their appearance and assistance in fundrais for this event undercut any claim of impartiality , and be unacceptable .
Scalia and Thomas have show little regard for critic who say they too readily mix the business of the court with agenda-driven group such as the federalist_society .
and Thomas '' wife , Ginni , be a high-profile conservative activist .
moreover , conservative argue that it be Justice elena_kagan who have an ethical issue , not Scalia and Thomas .
Kagan serve as solicitor_general in the Obama administration when the first legal challenge to the law be bring at the trial_court level .
her critic have push for Kagan to recuse herself from hear the case , say that she be too invest in defend the law then to be impartial now .
Kagan have give no indication she will do so .
the familiarity of the Spanish be high than that of the Ticos
of the @card@ player call in Spain , ten pass @card@ international game .
on the side of costa_rica only one of @card@ call player reach @card@ game .
a minor contrast to costa_rica , compare the @card@ player call by both country for the friendly game today , at @card@ pm at the national_stadium in san_jose .
while the Europe and world_champion , number_one one in the monthly top of FIFA , have a long record of class_a inter selection , the Tricolor have only the defender michael_umana as the only one who have @card@ international game .
that number be reach Friday before the game against Panama ( @card@ ) , in rommel_fernandez .
Spanish football_player play in the All-Star League and in powerful club of the premier_league of England be during the year very active in league and local cup competition and there be high-level shock in the European_Cup and European_Champions_League .
To this be add the Spanish fury experience in complicated qualification for Euro_Cup and world_cup .
the Ticos player , however , have a limited international experience in an area such as CONCACAF , which be consider the low level within FIFA
we see that the peak of the Spanish selection be the goalkeeper iker_casillas , who last Saturday against England ( game lose with @card@ in London ) equal the record of the ex goalkeeper andoni_zubizarreta , with @card@ international match .
Casillas will play today against the tricolor and will impose a new record of @card@ international match for Spain .
xavi_hernandez , the player of Barcelona , have @card@ match .
Casillas and Xavi be recognize last week by UEFA together with the other player of the Iberian team , Zubizarreta with @card@ match and Schalke striker raul_gonzalez with @card@ .
almost near the centennial number be carles_puyol , with @card@ game .
on Costa Rican side , and close to michael_umana , be the left-lateral junior_diaz , with @card@ match and the striker bryan_ruiz , with @card@ .
after this , only five exceed the @card@ game : Keilor Navas with @card@ , randall_azofeifa with @card@ , michael_barrantes with @card@ , carlos_hernandez with @card@ and jose_luis_lopez with @card@ .
more than @card@ match in Spain have gerard_piqu ( @card@ ) , sergio_busquets ( @card@ ) , Santiago santi_cazorla ( @card@ ) , alvaro_arbeloa ( @card@ ) and raul_albiol ( @card@ ) .
on the national side , with less than @card@ presence , there be roy_miller with @card@ , winston_parks with @card@ , gabriel_badilla with @card@ and roy_myrie with @card@ .
the rest do n't come near the @card@ .
while Nacho Moreal have only four game and jordi_alba two , in costa_rica victor_bolivar have only one olman_vargas and Nelson Edder do not debut yet .
the lead scorer of Spain be david_villa be , with @card@ goal , follow by fernando_torres with @card@ .
for Costa_Rica , bryan_ruiz be the one that register more point , two more than carlos_hernandez and three more than roy_myrie and Parks .
be immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy ?
immigration policy under nicolas_sarkozy be criticise from various aspect a congestion of police , legal and administrative service subject to a policy of number and the compatibility of that policy with the self-proclaimed status of the country as the country of French human_right .
more recently , it be administrative harassment of foreign student , which be topical , with the minister_of_the_interior ( `` Libration '' on @card@ May ) declare that France `` do not need foreign talent , bricklayer and waiter . ''
but it be only rarely analyze from the economic viewpoint .
there be a lot of consensus between the Left and the Right on this subject .
on the Right , the tone be set by jacques_chirac , who declare in @card@ that `` @card@ unemployed would not become a problem in a country with 2 million of foreign worker , '' and on the Left by michel_rocard explain in @card@ that France `` can not accommodate all the world 's misery . ''
the only difference , the degree of generosity
in @card@ , the fear of invasion of the national territory by horde of Polish plumber be feel both on the Left and on the Right .
both side see immigrant as a burden on the French economy and on French society .
the only difference reside in the degree of generosity , which one deign to grant to immigrant .
in his program , franois_hollande confine himself to banality , say that co-development would allow our immigration problem to be solve . ''
this notion of immigration be a burden and a problem , may be an electoral asset , but it be economically very costly .
as the economist ian_goldin and Geoffrey Cameron , remind us in a recent book summarise the most recent knowledge of immigration ( exceptional people : How Migration Shaped our world and Will Define Our Future , Mai @card@ , princeton_university_press , @card@ pp . ) , there be wide consensus among specialist on the positive impact of migration flow on economic_growth , wage and employment in country , which admit immigrant .
restraining immigration lead to anaemic growth and harm employment .
fear about the impact of immigrant be base on the notion that they be liable to replace native worker , in particular unskilled one , exert downward pressure on wage .
but experience show that in reality immigrant be much more complementary to , rather than replacement of , local labor , exercise trade in which there be a shortage of local labor .
