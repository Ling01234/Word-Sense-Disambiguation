U.N. group draft plan to reduce emission
the U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- characterize so far by unruly posturing and mutual recrimination -- gain renewed focus Friday with the release of a document outline ambitious greenhouse-gas reduction over the next @card@ year , with industrialized_nation shoulder most of the burden in the near term .
the text , which could provide the basis for a final political deal to regulate greenhouse_gas , highlight the remain obstacle as much as it illuminate a path forward .
but it be see as an important advance in a negotiation that be run out of time , with more than @card@ world leader arrive in Copenhagen next week .
forge by a U.N. ad-hoc working_group , the text be silent on how much money rich country would give poor one to cope with global_warming over the short and long term .
and it provide a range of option for the key question , include how developed and major emerging_economy would cut their carbon_output , and what would be the upper_limit of global temperature rise that policymaker would be willing to tolerate .
it give a lot of flexibility to the process , say John Coequyt , senior Washington representative for the sierra_club .
michael zammit Cutajar , who draft the six-page document , boil down a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the U.N. 's top climate official , yvo_de_boer , describe as `` the big picture . ''
it show the outline for a possible deal , in which industrial_nation would collectively cut their emission by @card@ by @card@ to @card@ percent compare with @card@ level , while major developing_country would reduce theirs during the same period by @card@ to @card@ percent .
together , the country would cut emission between @card@ and @card@ percent by @card@ .
the european_union give the talk a boost as well on Friday by pledge to provide $ @card@ billion a year over the next three year to help poor country adapt to the impact of climate_change -- from cope with flood and drought to avoid deforestation .
still , Friday feature the same sort of verbal firework that have dominate the talk for the past week .
U.S. special climate envoy todd_stern reject language require binding cut of greenhouse-gas emission for industrialized_country compare with voluntary one by major emerging_economy if they be not fund by the developed_world .
the move signal that the Obama_administration be take a hard_line with China than bush_administration official do just two year ago .
the united_states be not go to do a deal without the major developing_country step up and take action , say Stern , who also complain that the text do not do enough to make sure the cut could be verify by outside observer .
Stern make his comment an hour after Chinese vice foreign_minister he_yafei say America 's top climate negotiator be either lack `` common_sense '' or be `` extremely irresponsible '' for say earlier in the week that the united_states would not help China financially to cope with global_warming .
with the future economic trajectory of the world 's major_power at stake , fault_line have erupt both within the developing_world and between the industrial_world and emerging_economy .
the current battle be as much about save individual economy as save the planet , with china and united_states feuding over their respective obligation while poor nation insist that the world 's two_dozen most influential country be ignore the scientific imperative to take bold action .
Ricardo Ulate , a Costa Rican delegate , say it be not surprising that the major_power be fight over who should bear the cost for curb greenhouse_gas , even as vulnerable country have become more aggressive in seek to hold the big emitter accountable for their action .
this be clearly a game where a new economic hegemony be be develop , say Ulate , who also serve as the regional Mexico and central_america climate_change adviser for conservation_international .
some of the country most vulnerable to the impact of climate_change indicate they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen , although most of the major participant say the talk will produce a political deal at good .
the alliance_of_small_island_states , which have @card@ member , produce a 24-page draft treaty proposal early Friday morning .
Artur Runge-Metzger , who head international climate negotiation on behalf of the european_commission , say the push by small island_nation have `` put political pressure on the entire political process , '' in part because they be now unified and demanding action from emerging_economy such as china and india .
the talk take on new urgency as delegate focus on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issue before the head_of_government arrive to strike a deal .
high-level official such as Indian environment_minister jairam_ramesh and the Chinese vice minister step off plane and race through the bella_center 's hall to closed-door meeting and news_conference so they could stake out claim that will be arbitrate over the next week .
the sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where @card@ people move in and out of the convention_center each day , guitar-playing activist put on nightly show mock the country they think be sell out , and draft proposal be pass hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- pose a challenge .
the intensity be only build : nearly all of the key minister be now here , and as early as Wednesday @card@ head_of_government will be in Copenhagen .
we be get into the big_league , say carlos_manuel_rodriguez , vice_president for global policy at conservation_international .
the heavyweight be come .
